## Welcome to GitHub Pages

There is still a lot to be done in the exciting world of programming! As I am still working on couple of projects which I will reveal soon, I will have to make you wait some time. For now I thought you might be interested in quite useful feature which is Markdown language. You can read about it below.

Here is the [link to the Wikipedia page about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Tymotheus/Tymotheus.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Tymotheus/Tymotheus.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
