## Stay awhile and listen...

There is still a lot to be done in the exciting world of programming! As I am still working on couple of projects which I will reveal soon, I will have to make you wait some time. For now, I thought you might be interested in quite useful feature which is Markdown language. You can read about it below.

Here is the link to [Wikipedia page about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

PS Feel free to contact me if you have any interesting projects in your mind!

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
Cool, isn't it?

### Jekyll Themes

Remember that if you create a page like this, you can use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your repository settings. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
